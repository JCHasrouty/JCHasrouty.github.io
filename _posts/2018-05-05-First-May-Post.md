title: May Update
---
Checking in to leave a May update. It's been very interesting how powerful Python is. I recently learned string manipulation (somewhat in depth) in class and I can say any string related issue could be easily solved with Python. Super popular and powerful language.

I've also been itching to make a pirate themed game in Unreal so i'm planning on taking that up as a side project myself. I was recently introduced to VR (never tried it before) and it has to be one of the coolest things ever. Definitely planning on working with some type of VR down the road. Luckily, I will be working on VR this summer at NASA at the Johnson Space Center. Super stoked about it and can't wait to blog about it. Going to try taking as many pics as possible and learn as much as I can.

Should be working on a racing type of game today with my man Thomas, will post some updates on that as well when I get the chance. 

SUNDAYS ARE FOR GAME DEV!!! 

Stay tuned for more...
