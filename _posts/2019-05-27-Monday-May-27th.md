## Bixel Exchange - Boingo Wireless
This past Thursday May 23rd, I had the pleasure of attending a Technical Interview Workshop at Boingo Wireless. I wasexcited and nervous because I didn't know what to expect. They told us we'd arrive get a tour of the place, have lunch with Software Engineers from the company, and then practice a mock technical interview (provided to us by the engineers). 

They organized us into groups based off of our programming skill levels. It was interesting to meet individuals with different backgrounds and visions of the industry. Being able to pick the Software Engineers brains is always fun because you get to see the world from their perspective. It was interesting to note that one of the Engineers in my group, Pia, graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. She is currently working as a Software Engineer developingand handling most of the Web Applications. 

The story behind it is, she had an internship with Boingo Wireless the previous Summer and asked if she could try something new to branch out essentially. She ended up excelling really well and picked up the languages and craft thus leading to her full time position. 

Fast forward to the Technical Interview, I felt very prepared. The question the engineers asked us was how to find a given subset of a string. My mind raced in a million directions; there are always more than one way to solve a problem. My first thought was we could use a stack. My teammate said we could use an array and run a couple for loops to check between each. As we struggledwith it I noticed that everyone was contributing great ideas to solve it but there was one issue. **Nobody took the time to drawit out and understand how the problem was working in order to develop a solution.** I was thinking of doing this the whole timebecause as everyone threw out ideas, I was slowly drifting into a deeper state of confusion. I then drew a figure of how it would work and it became evident to all of us what approach we should take. Unfortunately, we ran out of time but ended up correcting the Software Engineer on the solutionhe provided us... lol. 

Overall, it was an awesome experience and I'm glad I was able to participate in it. I was able to learn a lot and took away a great deal of lessons with me. 

#### Important Take-aways
* Always try new things because you never know what you could be really good at
* Be confident in your skills, nobody is perfect and everyone is learning/improving on a daily basis
* Ask as many questions as you can during a technical interview - this helps show your thought process and provide more clarification to help solve the problem 
* Before you jump right into code, break down the problem, draw it out and understand it as a whole without paying attention to the details at first **This is _super_ important** 

Anyways, got some other things in development and will be writing about them soon. Going to enjoy the rest of my Memorial Day. Take it easy.
